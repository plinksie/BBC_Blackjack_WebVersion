# üÉè BBC Blackjack Web Version üÉè

Welcome to the **Web Version** of my Blackjack project for the BBC's Software Engineering tech test! This version builds upon the previous **console-based implementation** by introducing an interactive web interface using Flask, providing a playable experience via a web browser.

---

## üöÄ Key Enhancements in This Version

### 1. **Interactive Web Interface**

- **Flask Integration**: The game is now playable through a web browser, leveraging the Flask framework for routing and rendering.
- **Dynamic HTML Pages**: Instead of console output, players interact with y rendered HTML templates.

### 2. **Player-Friendly Design**

- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: The UI features:
  - A **white background** with clean, modern styling.
  - Black text for readability.
- **Custom Card Graphics**: The player‚Äôs and dealer‚Äôs cards are visually displayed in a clean, simple style (sourced from free APIs or local placeholders).

### 3. **Game Features Expanded**

- **Display of Player‚Äôs and Dealer‚Äôs Hands**: Cards and scores are dynamically updated on the browser interface.
- **Interactive Gameplay**:
  - Players can now click buttons to `Hit` or `Stand`.
  - The browser immediately updates the displayed game state.
- **Multiple Game States**:
  - `Game Over` Screen: Displays whether the player has won, lost, or tied.
  - Separate dealer and player phases, mimicking real Blackjack rules.

### 4. **Codebase Improvements**

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - HTML templates (stored in a `templates` folder) are used to handle the UI.
  - Core game logic remains modular and testable within Python classes.
- **Readability and Scalability**: The project‚Äôs structure now separates backend logic, web application routes, and front-end templates for easier scalability and maintenance.

### 5. **Ease of Access**

- **Localhost Setup**: Players can launch the game locally with minimal setup, using the `Flask` development server.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/plinksie/BBC_Blackjack_WebVersion.git
   cd BBC_Blackjack_WebVersion

   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies: (Add the following to the terminal)
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:(Add the following to the terminal)
   python src/app.py

4. Open the game in your browser:
   ‚Ä¢ Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

5. Enjoy the interactive gameplay:
   ‚Ä¢ Click Start Game to begin.
   ‚Ä¢ Choose Hit to draw another card or Stand to end your turn.
   ‚Ä¢ See the results on the final Result page.

## üìñ The brief given for the task:

Blackjack, otherwise known as Twenty-One, Vingt-et-Un, or Pontoon, is a classic card game, approximately 250 years old. For your tech assessment, you will write code that can simulate a hand of blackjack. You may use any programming language or framework(s) you think appropriate. Alternatively, you may build on the provided starter code (in Python 3.)

The goal of the game is to get a hand of cards that‚Äôs worth as close to 21 points as possible. If a player‚Äôs hand goes over 21 points, they have lost.

The player is initially dealt two cards. They may then choose to ‚Äòhit‚Äô (draw a card) or ‚Äòstand‚Äô (stop drawing cards.) If they ‚Äòhit‚Äô, then the new card‚Äôs value is added to the hand total. If this total exceeds 21, the player is ‚Äòbust‚Äô, and loses.

Once all players have finished this process, the highest scoring hand wins.

Your solution should model a single deck of 52 cards:
Number cards are worth their face value (2-10)
Jacks, queens, and kings are worth 10 each
Aces are worth either 1 or 11 (player chooses)
The suit of the card does not matter.

‚úÖ Fulfilled: The Deck class models a standard 52-card deck with correct ranks and suits. The Deck is properly initialized with all cards, shuffled, and allows cards to be dealt.
‚úÖ Fulfilled: Your Deck class models a standard 52-card deck with correct ranks and suits. The Deck is properly initialized with all cards, shuffled, and allows cards to be dealt.
‚úÖ Fulfilled: The calculate_score() method in the Hand class correctly checks if the hand total exceeds 21. This allows you to determine if the player is ‚Äúbust.‚Äù
‚úÖ Fulfilled: The current implementation provides all the mechanics needed to simulate a basic hand of blackjack.
‚úÖ Fulfilled: The calculate_score() method automatically adjusts Ace values based on the total hand score, which mimics the player‚Äôs decision.

## Rules of Blackjack:

Welcome to Blackjack, the timeless card game of strategy and luck! Here‚Äôs how you can play my version of the game:

üÉè Rules of the Game

    1.	The goal is to get a hand as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
    2.	Each card has a point value:
    ‚Ä¢	Number cards (2-10): Face value
    ‚Ä¢	Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): 10 points each
    ‚Ä¢	Ace: 1 or 11 points (whichever benefits the player)
    3.	You are initially dealt two cards.
    4.	Choose whether to:
    ‚Ä¢	Hit: Draw another card to increase your hand total.
    ‚Ä¢	Stand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.
    5.	If your hand exceeds 21 points, you‚Äôre bust, and you lose the round.

## üìñ About

This program focuses on simulating key aspects of Blackjack, including:

- Creating and managing a deck of cards.
- Calculating the score of a Blackjack hand.
- Using modern Python development practices, such as object-oriented design and unit testing.

## üÉè Features

- **52-card Deck**: Fully modeled with ranks and suits.
- **Shuffling**: Random deck order.
- **Card Dealing**: Simulates drawing cards from the top of the deck.
- **Blackjack Scoring**: Calculates hand scores with Ace handling.
